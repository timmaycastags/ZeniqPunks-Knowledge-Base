## Zeniq CryptoPunks
*New Chain, Same Punk*

Why [Zeniq](https://www.zeniq.com) blockchain?  I really don't know.  Zeniq is a proprietary blockchain.  The source code is not open.  The chain is being developed by a corporation.  Not only is the chain source code closed, the hardware to run a [node](https://safir.com/ref/sngj217quy) is also closed.  The only way to get a node is to purchase it from the corp.  The chain has plans to tokenize assets and make crypto easier via their proprietary hardware and software.  But, to reach to defi, they need a bridge.  And that bridge is a EVM clone called [ZEN-20](https://chainlist.org/?search=zeniq).

And quite frankly, that is where they fucked up.

## Cryptoweb
The proliferation of crypto networks is due to the success of [Bitcoin](https://nakamotoinstitute.org).  Bitcoins introduction as a peer-to-peer version of electronic cash has been revolutionary.  The bold idea of a pseudo anonymous, censorship resistant decentralized money has given power to anyone willing to "take the orange pill".  And with Bitcoins success, has come an endless amount of copycats.  Blockchains *can* be used to solve different problems,  but it doesn't mean they *should* be used.  The use case of the blockchain dictates its value.  The number one use case for blockchain is money.  Bitcoin solves this.  

Other blockchains have proven to shown value.  [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) has shown value with Defi and NFTs using smart contracts.  Copycats have come for Ethereum too.  And I believe you can't put pandora back in the box.  The future of the cryptoweb will be multi-chain and multi-layer.  These chains and layers will be interoperable. Value will flow at the speed of light, accelerated by technology and advances in AI.  Blockchains that take advantage of specific use cases and continue to build will have a fighting chance to compete in this future cryptoweb.  

## Cypherpunks and NFTs
Anonymity and cryptography are the heart that defines a [CryptoPunk](https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html).  In a digital free society, privacy is a right that needs a solution.  Cryptography gives people privacy to reveal what they want, to whom they wish.  Governments, big tech, and  corporations used the web to gather personal data from willing users to exploit that information to the highest bidder.  Cryptopunks build and operate to defend privacy.  

I feel that is the original reason that profile picture [NFTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token) got popular were the fact that you could identify yourself anonymously on the blockchain.  Profile pictures have been used for messaging applications and social networks for giving a visual representation of an account.  It gives the user the choice of privacy.  NFT profile pictures perform the same function, but with the added benefit of being on-chain.  I find NFTs to be a great complement to a privacy minded Crytopunk.

## Zeniqpunks History
The idea for the creation of ZeniqPunks came from a group of [SpacePunkClub](https://www.spacepunks.club/) members.  Spacepunks are a NFT project on the Ethereum blockchain.  Spacepunkclub decided to invest in Zeniq as a way to reward members.  Spacepunksclub (and Spacepunk members) own Zeniq nodes, hubs, and mint Zeniq projects like Tupan.  Spacepunk club minted tokens on the Zeniq blockchain are distributed to members as rewards.  Once the Zeniq EVM smart chain was annouced, it was a clear opportunity to estabilsh a NFT profile picture collection with ties back to Ethereum and the Spacepunks Club.
