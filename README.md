## Zeniq CryptoPunks
*New Chain, Same Punk*

[Zeniq](https://www.zeniq.com) is a proprietary blockchain.  The source code is not open.  The chain is being developed by a corporation.  Not only is the chain source code closed, the hardware to run a [node](https://safir.com/ref/sngj217quy) is also closed.  The only way to get a node is to purchase it from the corp.  The chain has plans to tokenize assets and make crypto easier via their proprietary hardware and software.  But to reach other blockchains, they need a bridge.  And that bridge is an EVM clone called [ZEN-20](https://chainlist.org/?search=zeniq).

And quite frankly, that is where they fucked up.

## Cryptoweb
The proliferation of crypto networks is due to the success of [Bitcoin](https://nakamotoinstitute.org).  Bitcoin's introduction as a peer-to-peer version of electronic cash has been revolutionary.  The bold idea of a pseudo anonymous, censorship resistant decentralized money has given power to anyone willing to "take the orange pill".  And with Bitcoins success, has come an endless amount of copycats.  Blockchains *can* be used to solve different problems,  but it doesn't mean they *should* be used.  The use case of the blockchain dictates its value.  The number one use case for blockchain is money.  Bitcoin solves this.  

Other blockchains have proven to show value.  [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) has shown value with Defi and NFTs using smart contracts.  Copycats have come for Ethereum too.  And I believe you can't put Pandora back in the box.  The future of the cryptoweb will be multi-chain and multi-layer.  These chains and layers will be interoperable. Value will flow at the speed of light, accelerated by technology and advances in AI.  Blockchains that take advantage of specific use cases and continue to build will have a fighting chance to compete in this future cryptoweb.  

## Cypherpunks and NFTs
Anonymity and cryptography are the heart that defines a [CypherPunk](https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html).  In a digital free society, privacy is a right that needs a solution.  Cryptography gives people privacy to reveal what they want, to whom they wish.  Governments, big tech, and  corporations used the web to gather personal data from willing users to exploit that information to the highest bidder.  Cryptopunks build and operate to defend privacy.  

I feel the original reason that profile picture [NFTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token) got popular was the fact that you could identify yourself pseudo anonymously on the blockchain.  Profile pictures have been used for messaging applications and social networks for giving a visual representation of an account.  It gives the user the choice of privacy.  NFT profile pictures perform the same function, but with the added benefit of being on-chain.  I find NFTs to be a great compliment to a privacy minded Cryptopunk.

## Zeniq Punks History
The idea for the creation of Zeniq Punks came from a group of [SpacePunk Club](https://www.spacepunks.club/) members.  Spacepunks are a NFT project on the Ethereum blockchain.  Like most NFT projects, the club was rugged by founders (twice) and left to defend for itself.  The crypto enthusiasts that remained at Spacepunk Club decided to invest in Zeniq.  Spacepunk Club (and Spacepunk members) own Zeniq nodes, hubs, and mint Zeniq projects like [Tupan](https://www.tupan.io/).  Spacepunk Club community minted tokens from the Zeniq hubs are distributed to members as rewards.  

When the Zeniq EVM smart chain was announced, it was a clear opportunity to establish a NFT profile picture collection with ties back to Ethereum and the Space Punks Club. It also marks the beginning of a new community on ZENIQ.  With that in mind, I decided to utilize popular Ethereum culture, counter culture, and sprinkle it with Spacepunks culture to make ZENIQ CryptoPunks.  Blockchains tell a story that can't be altered, forever ingrained in the chain.  Truth is there for the ones willing to take the journey.  I won't rob you the pleasure of digging yourself.  A good guide comes from the Phunks [Knowledge Base](https://phunks.gitbook.io/knowledge-base/resources/history).    


## Zeniq Punks Future
The future of Zeniq CryptoPunks is yet to be written; and it won't be written by me alone.  It is not my intention to "lead" this collection.  In fact it's quite the opposite.  I invite ZENIQ blockchain enthusiasts to join in this journey.  Feel free to reach out to collaborate.
