## Zeniq CryptoPunks
*New Chain, Same Punk*

Why [Zeniq](https://www.zeniq.com) blockchain?  I really don't know.  Zeniq is a proprietary blockchain.  The source code is not open.  The chain is being developed by a corporation.  Not only is the chain closed, the hardware to run a node is also closed.  The only way to get a node is to purchase it from the corp.  The chain has plans to tokenize assets and make crypto easier via their proprietary hardware and software.  But, to reach to defi, they need a bridge.  And that bridge is a EVM clone called [ZEN-20](https://chainlist.org/?search=zeniq).

And quite frankly, that is where they fucked up.

## Cryptoweb
The proliferation of crypto networks is due to the success of [Bitcoin](https://nakamotoinstitute.org).  Bitcoins introduction as a peer-to-peer version of electronic cash has been a revolution.  The bold ideas of a censorship resistant, decentralized money have given power to anyone willing to "take the orange pill".  And with Bitcoins success has come an endless amount of copycats.  These copycats mostly serve one purpose.  They are vechiles for speculation where the only purpose to get profits to aquire more Bitcoin.  Blockchains *can* be used to solve different problems,  but it doesn't mean they *should* be used.  The number one use case for blockchain is money.  Bitcoin solves this.  

Other blockchain technologies aren't necessarily trying to solve the money problem.  Ethereum has shown value with Defi and NFT technology using smart contract.
